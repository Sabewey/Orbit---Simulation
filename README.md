# Orbit---Simulation
Simple Orbit simulation. 
I would like be able to analyze the orbit and have heard that one can use SVG to easily zoom in and out on the different parts while the graphics remains clear. Do you have any suggestions for what type of method to graph the simulation that I have created?
